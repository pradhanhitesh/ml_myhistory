# ml_detectionsys

This repository contains my first few machine learning-based prediction systems created in Python. The objective of keeping a track of my codes is to understand and analyse my mistakes and make progress in the longer run. This would also help other developers in the community to go through my codes and suggest me few changes. Thank you! :)
